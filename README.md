# Android Budgeting App
**Group 8**  
**Contrbutors:** Brandon Lam, Hamzah Bemat, Jed Rendo Magracia, Talike Bennett

## Summary
Our group has designed a budgeting app that organizes the userâ€™s income and expenses. For example, subscriptions to services like Netflix and Amazon Prime will be displayed at hand whenever necessary. Users will also be able to link any credit or debit cards to have quick access to their digital finances. Items added to the app can be edited or removed at any time. We have also incorporated additional useful features (such as reminders and personal goals) and created a modern design that users will find visually appealing. With all expenses and sources of income in one place, we hope users will find it easier to organize their finances, analyze spending patterns, pay bills on time, and more.
